All through the summer and well into the fall, the data science teams at Premise have seen Asian economies struggle with inflation — though if you’ve been looking only at the headline numbers, you might have missed it. As recently as this past week, the National Bureau of Statistics of China reported that [consumer prices rose](http://www.cnbc.com/id/101184347) 0.1 percent month-over-month, underperforming economists’ predictions of a 0.2 percent increase. A modest number, to be sure, but one that tells only part of the story: since early July, the teams at Premise have seen vegetable prices in China rising at a rapid clip.
