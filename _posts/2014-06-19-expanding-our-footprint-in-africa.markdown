We're thrilled to announce that Premise is expanding our Africa footprint, partnering with Standard Chartered, the international bank located in 70 countries across the globe and with more than 150 years of experience in Africa alone, to launch a set of pioneering economic indicators for Nigeria and Ghana.

It’s no secret that Africa has extremely strong investment potential but many African markets have historically been opaque. The global financial community has had little insight into the true health of these nations – or their economic potential. This is the first step in closing the information gap. Premise’s data, captured by our ever-expanding network of data contributors, will power these indicators, helping to lift the veil on some of the continent’s most dynamic markets poised for hyper growth.

The partnership with Standard Chartered, the exponential expansion of our network, and the geographies in which we’re beginning to come online offer a small glimpse into our progress to date. There’s much more to come, so stay tuned.
